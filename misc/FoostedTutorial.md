# Ultimate Accessible Foosted Build Tutorial

## Overview

This post will explain in detail how to build your own Foosted DIY board, so you can enjoy an unrivaled urban surfing experience with the best authentic skate hardware.

## Required Skills and Equiptment

We did our best to select parts that don't require soldering, glueing, dremelling, etc to assemble, and the basic skills required to put this board together can be picked up during the build process. Additionally, no expensive equiptment is needed, but a workbench with a basic toolset is highly recommended. At a minimum, the following affordable tools will be necessary:

- A soldering iron, solder, wire strippers, and heat shrinks or electrical tape (very little soldering is actually needed)
- A drill and drill bits
- Hex keys
- A basic wrench set (socket wrenches may be the most convenient to work with)

## Ordering the Parts

Many of these parts can swapped out to save money or better suit a builder's design preferences. However, we can't guarentee that other parts will fit together as easily as the ones we've chosen, so if you decide to venture off the beaten path, be prepared to get your hands dirty. If money is an issue, consider building this board with a single motor/ESC. This will reduce traction somewhat, but performance should otherwise remain unchanged, as speed and acceleration are constrained by the battery.

- **ESC**: VESC 4.12 **AMAZON LINK**
- **Motors**: TorqueBoards 190 kV 6355 Outrunners **DIY LINK** -- These are not the cheapest motors, and almost any 6355 outrunner with roughly a 190 kV rating will work fine (sensorless motors included). However, the TorqueBoards motors come fitted with keyways and that work with the brand's pulley set, which eases the assembly process significantly.
- **Battery**: WowGo/Meepo/Ownboard Samsung 4.0 10s2p (or 6.0 as a potential upgrade) -- This battery comes with a built-in BMS and plugs straight into the enclosure's charging port (no soldering). It can ouput 40 A continuously, but it's probably better to use lower current limits, as this will drain the battery extremely quickly.

## Build Step 1: The Rear Truck Assembly

### 1.1) Secure the wheel pulleys to the rear wheels

This is a very easy step, but remember to apply Loctite to each bolt and be careful not to overtighten, as this can warp the wheel's urathane and seat the pulley out of true. Spin the assembled wheels on one of the trucks to check your work. If a pulley appears to wobble significantly, loosen over-tightened bolts until it spins correctly.

### 1.2) Add attatch the motor arms to the truck clamps
For this step, there's no need to tighen anything, nor is there any need to apply Loctite. Simply bolt the motor arms to the truck clamps in the desired orientation without tightening, allowing the arms to swing freely. Do not bother securing the locking nuts yet.

### 1.3) Attach the motors to the motor arms
As in the previous step, there's no need to tighen or add Loctite. Simply attach the motors to the arms so that they can slide freely within the tensioning tracks. We mounted the motors with the wires facing forward (away from the truck).

### 1.4) Secure the truck clamps to the rear truck
**This step is easy to get wrong. Follow the instruction carefully or be prepared to repeat your work!**. To make this step easier, a small amount of setup is requiered. First, add Loctite to the bolts and insert them into the truck clamps, threading only a small amount (the tips of the bolts should not be poking out the other side of the clamp). Second, slide the assembled clamp/arm/motor components onto the rear truck. Finally, install the wheels (with pulleys) onto the axels and tighten them down. With all the parts loosely mounted, you can now position the clamps and tighten them.

Position the first clamp such that the motor arm is roughly 3-5 mm from the wheel pulley. Next, note that the Caliber hangers have one rounded edge and one square edge. **It's critically important to seat the truck clamps into one of the corners of the square edge to ensure proper alignment and strength.** Specifically, you want to use the corner closer to the pavement, so impacts put the least possible stress on the screws. NOTE: This requires tightening the *opposing* bolts first. Start by using one hand to push the mount into the correct corner, then begin tightening the bolt facing the curved surface of the truck. Tighten with a fair amount of force, but don't worry about wrenching on the bolt yet. Repeat this step on the bolt next to it (facing up towards the deck when mounted). Finally, tighten the remaining bolts in the same fashion.

Finally, grab a pair of pliers, a skate tool, or something you can use to leverage the hex key (also be sure you're using a hex key that fits the bolt snugly). **In the same order**, wrench on each bolt again with your leveraging tool of choice until the key is near the point of failure. By the time you've finished, your hex key should ideally be slightly twisted. Repeat these steps for the second motor mount.

### 1.5) Secure the rear truck to the deck

Insert a riser pad and bolt the rear truck to the deck.

### 1.6) Tighten down the motor arms

To help align the arms before tighening, begin by sliding both motors to the ends of the tensioning rails (the point of maximum belt tension if belts were installed). The motors can't be mounted too close to the deck, or they'll bite during turns, but leaving too much space will reduce ground clearance. We found a gap of roughly 2cm to be ideal. An easy way to get near perfect spacing is to rest the motors on one of the truck bushings while tightening the mount (you'll need to temporarily remove one from the front truck to do this if you don't have extras lying around).

To secure the arms, first tighten down the bolts applying as much force as you can with just the hex key (no need for a leveraging device). Next, add the nuts to the back of each bolt and wrench these down as hard as you can.

### 1.7 Add the motor pulleys and belts

Very easy step. Filing.
